                Within this part of my career I took on a role of motivation and
                mentorship. This involved creating an environment (guild) where

                A couple of years ago during a gaming session with friends I
                received the nickname "MeloneGuy". You see, I love the flavor of
                melons, especially watermelons. Those sweet, refreshing slices
                are like bites of summer on a hot day.
              </p>
              <p class="night quote">
                Think about it.. The worst part of a watermelon tastes like the
                best part of a cucumber.

                I have a passion for exploring Earth's natural wonders, diverse
                cultures and the beauty of our planet. Traveling allows me to
                indulge myself in nature and cultures. It's a journey where I
                can witness the great outdoors and the beauty of plants, cities
                and wildlife.

                In my kitchen, I try to unleash my creativity by combining
                flavors from around the world into my meals, one dish at a time.
                I have a deep passion for experimenting with diverse cuisines
                and savor the joy of cooking dishes from various cultures, each
                with its unique taste and character. I dream of one day creating
                my own cookbook, a way to share my love for diverse recipes and
                flavours with the world.

                I enjoy swimming and regular gym workouts in combination with
                bouldering to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. This
                commitment to well-being not only keeps me physically fit but
                also stimulate my resilience and focus, qualities that I believe
                are essential.
