                I love to travel because it opens up a world of new experiences 
                and perspectives. Each destination offers unique cultures, 
                landscapes, and stories that enrich my understanding of the world. 
                Exploring different places allows me to break from routine, embrace 
                spontaneity, and connect with people from diverse backgrounds. The 
                thrill of discovering unfamiliar destinations and the joy of making 
                lasting memories are what make travel such a rewarding and 
                invigorating experience for me. Last year I visited 7 countries.

                I cherish spending time with friends and family because it brings a 
                sense of joy and belonging that enriches my life. Their presence 
                offers comfort, support, and shared laughter, creating moments of 
                connection and happiness. Whether it's through meaningful conversations,
                shared activities, or simply being together, these relationships provide
                a sense of community and grounding that makes life more fulfilling and memorable.

                I enjoy working out and dancing. This commitment to well-being 
                not only keeps me physically fit but also stimulate my resilience 
                and focus, qualities that I believe are essential.

                Reading offers an escape into different worlds and perspectives, 
                allowing me to explore new ideas and experiences from the comfort 
                of my own space. My favorite genres are fiction and autobiographies.
